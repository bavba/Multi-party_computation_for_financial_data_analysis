### [Multi-party computation for financial data analysis:](https://github.com/bavba/Multi-party_computation_for_financial_data_analysis/)

Multi-Party Computation transforms data handling by decentralizing trust among multiple participants.

This ensures that no single entity demands absolute trust.

An advantage for companies in safeguarding data privacy: once data leaves the user's computer, it remains obscured from any single external entity.
